# Word Search

In word search puzzles you get a square of letters and have to find specific
words in them.

For example:

```text
jefblpepre
camdcimgtc
oivokprjsm
pbwasqroua
rixilelhrs
wolcqlirpc
screeaumgr
alxhpburyi
jalaycalmp
clojurermt
```

There are several programming languages hidden in the above square.

Words can be hidden in all kinds of directions: left-to-right, right-to-left,
vertical and diagonal.

Given a puzzle and a list of words return the location of the first and last
letter of each word.
## Setup

Go through the setup instructions for TypeScript to install the necessary
dependencies:

[https://exercism.io/tracks/typescript/installation](https://exercism.io/tracks/typescript/installation)

## Requirements

Install assignment dependencies:

```bash
$ yarn install
```

## Making the test suite pass

Execute the tests with:

```bash
$ yarn test
```

In the test suites all tests but the first have been skipped.

Once you get a test passing, you can enable the next one by changing `xit` to
`it`.

## Source

This is a classic toy problem, but we were reminded of it by seeing it in the Go Tour.

## Submitting Incomplete Solutions

It's possible to submit an incomplete solution so you can see how others have
completed the exercise.
