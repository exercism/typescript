A queen must be placed on a valid position on the board.
Two queens cannot share the same position.

If a position has not been given, the queens are at their [default starting positions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rules_of_chess#Initial_setup). That's the bottom row (1) for the white queen and the top row (8) for the black queen. Both queens start in the fourth column (d).
